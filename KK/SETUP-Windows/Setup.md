# Setting up prerequisites - wsl & Docker 

## Step 1: Install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)

Open any terminal (cmd or PowerShell) as an administrator and run the following command:

```bash
wsl --install
```

Follow the prompted steps to set up WSL, including providing a username and password. Once completed, close and reopen the shell.

## Step 2: Install Docker

Open the terminal in WSL and execute the following commands to set up Docker using the apt repository:

```bash
# Add Docker's official GPG key:
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add the repository to Apt sources:
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update
```

Note: If you use an Ubuntu derivative distro, such as Linux Mint, you may need to use UBUNTU_CODENAME instead of VERSION_CODENAME.

## Step 3: Install Docker Packages

To install the latest version of Docker, run the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```

## Step 4: Verify Docker Installation

Ensure that Docker Engine is installed successfully by running the following command:

```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```

This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. When the container runs, it prints a confirmation message and exits.

# Hadoop Installation

## Step 1: Clone docker-hadoop repository

Clone the docker-hadoop repository from GitHub. If you're using the console, run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/big-data-europe/docker-hadoop
```
![git clone](https://github.com/kartabyakrishna/KartabyaKrishna/blob/main/Assets/setup-Windows/gitclone.png)

## Step 2: Start necessary containers using docker-compose

Run the following command to start the necessary containers after moving into the docker-hadoop folder using **`cd docker-hadoop`**. This command will initiate the five required containers. If it's the first time, you may need to wait for the download to finish.

```bash
sudo docker-compose up -d
```
![sudo docker-compose up -d](https://github.com/kartabyakrishna/KartabyaKrishna/blob/main/Assets/setup-Windows/sudo%20docker-compose%20up%20-d.png)
**...**

This code might not work if you don't have `docker-compose` installed. So run the following command to install it.
![docker compose not found](https://github.com/kartabyakrishna/KartabyaKrishna/blob/main/Assets/setup-Windows/Screenshot%202024-03-05%20210907.png)
```bash
sudo apt install docker-compose
```
![sudo apt install docker-compose](https://github.com/kartabyakrishna/KartabyaKrishna/blob/main/Assets/setup-Windows/sudo%20apt%20install%20docker-compose.png)
Then you can execute the `sudo docker-compose up -d` normally.

## Step 3: Access the master node "namenode"

Get into the namenode container, which serves as the master node of the Hadoop cluster. It's a mini-linux environment that allows managing the HDFS file system.

```bash
sudo docker exec -it namenode bash
```

![sudo docker exec -it namenode bash](https://github.com/kartabyakrishna/KartabyaKrishna/blob/main/Assets/setup-Windows/sudo%20docker%20exec%20-it%20namenode%20bash.png)

## Step 4: Create folder structure to allocate input files

List all files in the HDFS system:

```bash
hdfs dfs -l /
```

Create the required folder structure (/user/root/) as Hadoop works with this defined structure:

```bash
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/root
```

Verify if the folder was created successfully:

```bash
hdfs dfs -ls /user/
```

Continue to the next step when you're ready.
